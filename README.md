# Sad-Machine-Druid
An Obsidian theme based on 0xGlitchbyte's Everforest port. Colors shifted away from red/green toward blue/green

Future plans include updating fonts, shifting the rest of the colors away from reds, updating light mode (dark mode changes only for now), improving markdown visibility for easier writing experience, and any future features I decide I want.
